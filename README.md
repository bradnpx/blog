This project is purely for recruitment purposes only. I don't write a blog. I think I did that back in the '00s with LiveJournal - man that takes me back!

Anyway, this was built on NextJS

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then tune in to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) .
