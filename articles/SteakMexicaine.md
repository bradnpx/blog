### What? You thought this was just dummy data?
# Steak Mexicaine
Obligatory story about how this recipe was handed down from my great great grandmother, don't forget to include specific detail about one little portion of the cooking that's like two seconds and it's over. (TODO: rambling story must be 200 pages long, come back and flesh this out...)

Ok, now that THAT'S out of the way. No, it's in a book that's been in the house longer than I have, whaddya want.

- Skirt steak (don't ask me how much, ask yourself how much meat do you like)
- flour
- olive oil
- 1 onion sliced thin
- 2-3 cloves of garlic diced
- 1 pepper, also sliced thin
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tsp chili powder
- tomato paste
- 1 can crushed tomatoes
- salt & pepa

0. Preheat oven to 325F. Yes, this is step zero. I forgot this one should be first.
1. Cut the skirt steak into pieces, roughly the size and shape of your index and middle finger. Yes, it's that kind of recipe
2. coat the steak pieces in flour. You can season it if you'd like, we use McCormick's Garlic + Herb on everything
3. Coat a hot pan on medium-high heat with about a tablespoon of olive oil. It doesn't have to fully coat the pan, just enough for all the meat. 
    DO NOT DROWN THE MEAT IN OIL. This ain't no deep fry
4. Let the meat brown on all sides, just a few minutes, then remove them and set aside
5. Onions in the pan. You can reduce the heat to medium. Take that spatula and scrape off the steak bits still in the pan. Cook it with the onions. Delish. Cook till onions are soft and glassy.
6. Garlic in the pan. Stir consistenly for a minute, don't overcook garlic. Don't do it.
7. Peppers, same treatment as the onions
8. At this point you can start adding your spices. If you're like me, just eyeball the amount. Remember the chili powder will add heat, don't burn your face off. Unless you're into that. Let them toast a bit then mix in
9. Do the same with the tomato paste: eyeball, toast, mix
10. Add your can of tomatoes. Could be diced, crushed, minced, sauce, whatever, it's gonna mix all up anyway
    - you can add some wine too. I won't tell
11. Add salt and pepper to taste. Careful with the salt, this dish can taste too salty real easily
12. Return the meat to the pan, mix and cover the pan with a lid. 
13. Put the pan in the oven. Slow and low, about 2 hours. Serve with rice
