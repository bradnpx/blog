# Hello World!
## No, seriously, hello to the world. It is I, Brad.
Yep, it's me. Ya boi made a blog. Why? Cause y'all won't hire me unless I show you I know what I'm doing. Well... now you know!

## You're still reading this? Uh, ok...
I was born in the Bronx - well, born at what's now NYU Langone on the East Side, but still raised in the Bronx! Riverdale, to be precise. Sounds like I should be friends with Archie. If you don't know who that is, let me show you my AARP card.

I've been dabbling in code since 1997 when I bought my first domain. They were humble beginnings: HTML with inline styling, using Dreamweaver to auto-generate the most hideous code imaginable, you get the drill. My first job involving coding was at a boutique record label in New Rochelle. This was in 2004, and I doubled as a graphic/web designer and engineer. While I love making art, I found that most clients don't know what they want. A lot of hemming and hawing over the covers. Plus, this was for contemporary classical music and geared towards an older market, so I was ordered to use large type - larger than would have been elegant, but again not my call. 

That ambiguity led me to focus more on coding. It was concrete. It worked, or it didn't. Sure I've learned over the years that coding can be elegant, efficient and secure. It could also be the complete opposite of those. By then I knew my essentials: HTML, CSS, some JavaSript. But I needed to branch out. So I picked up PHP, started making external data calls, learned to get under the hood of WordPress.

### Speaking of WordPress
One of my jobs was working with the Yii framework. It was a challenge, and don't ask me to remember any of it cause I was mostly frontend anyway. But the backend engineers ragequit one day, and the boss was like "We need to get off Yii." The website was all content, much like this one, just a lot of articles, recipes and embedded videos. The backend devs created a CMS that looked almost exactly like WordPress, so the writers were used to that UI. So I felt it only made sense to cut out the middleware and switch to WordPress. At least that way we could hit the ground running and be able to bring new features to our writers right out of the box. So I led the team in migrating our data to WP. It was a large task, but we managed to get it done pretty quickly. The writers were thankful, and frankly I was too, just to be able to work with actual WordPress.

### Onward
That job served its purpose, but it was time for me to move on. I freelanced, bounced around a few projects, got involved in some of the emerging MVC frameworks such as Angular 1.x and Ember. Eventually I landed at NYU Langone, the place of my birth. Ironic? Not sure if that's the right word to describe it, but that's all I got right now. NYU was just building out their 'Find a Doc' tool, but they didn't have a frontend engineer so the data had nowhere to go yet. Now, NYU was still a VanillaJS site back then, so we didn't get to play with the new toys yet. But I DID help them get an MVP up and running in less than 2 months, which was faster than originally estimated by the team. I'd done enough scaffolding over the years that I knew what it took to get something up **fast**.

A few months in, we decided we were going React with the Doc tool. It was still lightweight enough that tearing it apart and rebuilding it wasn't this horrible ordeal. After finishing Find a Doc, we started spinning up new applets and features on the site in React: Online Scheduling, Insurance Payor/Plan selection, Virtual Urgent Care. I worked on each of those projects - not at the same time, and not forever, per se. 

The teams grew and split, and I found myself in the end working on the article-based portion of the site. It was written in PHP/Symfony, with Drupal 6 as a back end. We never did get to use cutting edge technology, but stability was paramount to the team's mission statement. After all, patients had to be able to trust that the site wasn't going to break down on them and prevent them from getting the care they needed. We had also spun up some of the pages in Python using Flask as our framework. It was quick and lightweight, which was great when we were rolling out the infrastructure for some of these new features.

### And what about now?
Well, now I'm unattached once again and looking for work! I'm entertaining both full-time and contract jobs.

### Yeah, but we could hire a 30-year-old to do this
You could, sure. The younger generation will be sharper than I am. But (oh boy, he's gonna say it) I have **EXPERIENCE** (sigh). But seriously, web development is more than just the code. It's making sure you're using the right tools for the job. It's knowing when changing platforms JUST because you want the shiny new one is a huge undertaking, and the benefit must be weighed against the cost in time and effort. It's making sure you've got enough code coverage and have unit tests written for just about everything. It's also knowing how to work the triangle (Fast, Cheap, Good), and not just the two that you prefer. Not to mention you have to have the communication skills to share these ideas with your colleagues, your stakeholders, your boss, your mentors/mentees. And that's something that only comes with experience. If you're good at that from the start, may I suggest public speaking instead of coding?

Nah, who am I to discourage anyone from picking their own career? I've been writing music and dabbling in 3d animation on the side for about as long as I've been coding. And yes, I'm learning the keytar.

### So there you have it!
I've pled my case. There's 20+ years of experience here, and I am hungry and ready to go. Like ABBA says, take a chance on me!
